# JAVA CHAT
A multiuser chat made in java and using sockets and MySQL.

To use you have to start MySQL and create a user named "java_chat" with the password "java_chat", and create a database with the same name (if you want to use custom values, change them in Server/MySql.java).
Then execute SetUpDB.java that will create the tables.
Run Server/Main.java to start the server.
Run Client/Main.java to start the client application.
